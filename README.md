This repository is a follow along of The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla.
Throughout this course, I will make changes to projects that I feel like I am able and capable of making. 
This will ensure I am comprehending the material being presented and able to articulate it in a unique way.
I will do one lesson a day minimum. 
Edit:
I am approximately 50% complete with the course. I am enjoying the contents so far.
I do feel like I am learning more in this course than the previous one I did on Udemy.
My only complaint:
It took a bit to get used to how the instructor is using Jupyter Notebook, but that has been my only stuggle so far.
I do see why he chose Jupyter though. You can more easily see what is being stored or executed without extra functions 
being used, ie; print(). This alleviates students having to run their code several times over in their IDE, what I
currently do.
